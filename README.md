# Simple Shell Project Overview

The Simple Shell project involves creating a UNIX command-line interpreter. It encompasses programming basics, C language fundamentals, and engineering thinking.

**Key Features:**
- **Basic Shell (0.1):** Displays prompts, executes simple commands, handles errors, and end-of-file conditions.
- **Command Handling (0.2):** Extended to handle command lines with arguments.
- **Path Handling (0.3):** Handles PATH, avoids unnecessary fork calls.
- **Exit Built-in (0.4):** Implements the exit built-in for shell termination.
- **Environment Printing (1.0):** Adds the env built-in to print the current environment.
- **Custom getline (0.1.1):** Implements a custom getline function for efficient character reading.
- **No Strtok Allowed (0.2.1):** Prohibits the use of strtok.
- **Exit Status Handling (0.4.1):** Enhances exit built-in to handle exit status.
- **Setenv, Unsetenv (Advanced):** Implements setenv and unsetenv built-ins.
- **Change Directory (Advanced):** Implements the cd built-in with PWD updates.
- **Command Separators (Advanced):** Handles ; for sequential command execution.
- **Logical Operators (Advanced):** Handles && and || logical operators.
- **Alias (Advanced):** Implements the alias built-in for defining, printing, or listing aliases.
- **Variable Handling (Advanced):** Handles variable replacement including $? and $$.
- **Comments Handling (Advanced):** Allows handling of comments marked by #.
- **File Input (Advanced):** Enables the shell to take a file as a command-line argument.

**Project Completion:**
The completion of this project, marks a significant milestone, showcasing the ability to create a fundamental UNIX command interpreter.
